    - View More Information
      - As a recipient, I want to be able to view: the description, category, delivery method, condition, and quantity of item(s) in a donor's active post, so that I can evaluate whether or not my organization would be able to receive, or benefit from receiving, the posted donation.

 - **Team Reflection**
   - Chloe completed the view more information, edit post, delete post, and message donor activities and 
  worked on creating tests for new activities created this sprint
   - Megan added four new activities to be able to "post" an item to a new branch in the database to mark items as donated to create the donor historic record and then view the items in the donor historic record
   - Matthew Scott made the item list view in the recipient layout and the filters for item listing (Matthew Stewart helped with filter too)
   - This sprint we were able to complete more than past sprints because we have a better understanding of the databases we have created on Firebase and are more familier with Android Studio and github
   - We learned that some of the original functionalities we had planned on creating for this app were much more complex than 
  originally thought so we had to rework some of the activities so we could finish as much as possible for the final sprint
   - Originally we thought that we could have notifications between recipients and donors and an in-app messaging system,we also wanted recipients to be able to favorite items and to be able to create a wishlist and receive notifications if an item from their list waas posted, we were also not able to complete the recipient historic record
