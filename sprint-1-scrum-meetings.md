## Scrum Meetings
The team is to meet for 10 days during the two-week sprint - 5 meetings per week. You must decide on a time to record your answers to the questions and then a single commit of the day's responses is to be made into your project repository for that day.

|            | Megan Spiers| Started the UML diagrams | Thought about who could do what part of project | Broke down sprint 1 Backlog | Worked on UML | Complete Today's Assignments | Started Designing UI | More work on sprint 1 basics | learned more about UI's | Added post item function to donor main screen | Fixed issue with delivery and condition attributes being reversed
|            | Matthew Scott |   Started the UML diagrams | drafting ideas for potential UML diagram / class model | We discussed our sprint 1 backlog and selected stories to work on | Met with TA to get clarification on Project | completed UML models | Begun working on basic app interface | more work on first app activity draft | more commits for activity
|            | Matthew Stewart | Started the UML diagrams |  Began modeling system  |  Divvy backlog for sprint 1  |  Completed some models  |  Started a project in A.S  |  Set up basic functionality  |  Researched different architecture designs  |  More research  |  cleaning up some files
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Chloe Adzima | Meet with TA | Create sprint 1 backlog | Start working on sprint 1 backlog | Finish UML diagrams | Start creating donor main activity screen | Start working on UI for sprint 1 | work on activity screen for posting an item | Work on functionality of posting item | Be able to print item data from database | finish sprint 1
|            | Megan Spiers |   Meet with TA | Brush up on our options for sprint 1 | Meet with TA for confirmation on sprint 1 | Complete Saturdays Assignments | Start Sprint 1 | Finish a UI | have a plan for finishing | research more info on Android studio | Fix issue with delivery and condition attributes being reversed | work on being able to edit an existing item
|            | Matthew Scott |   Meet with TA | Hopefully have some diagrams to show | research how to implement one our first activities | Have behavioral UML diagram complete | work on first app activity for project | have some code to submit | continue working on app interface | more commits for activity
|            | Matthew Stewart | Meet TA  |  Review backlog  |  Complete models  |  Start a draft in Android Studio  |  implement some basic functionality  |  Start testing / continue with today  |  Become familiar working with projects on git  |  Start organizing project files  |  flesh out a pattern for future code 
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Chloe Adzima | confused on requirements for UML diagrams | Not sure what user stories we will be able to complete this sprint | time/other classes | unsure how to make UML diagrams correctly | worried about how github will work with Android Studio | Midterms | studying for test in this class and other classes | Midterms | Hard to get data from database | Could not figure out how to have users upload pictures of items
|            | Megan Spiers |   Not understanding the material | time; other classes | Completeing a sprint during midterm Week | Car broke down :( | Work | All previously listed Reasons | midterms | Midterm week | spent all data learning how firebase works | General lack of android studio
|            | Matthew Scott |   Other projects and assignments going on | Other classes for now / early stage uncertainty | studying for this midterm | havent completed every diagram yet | just learning details of android API and java still before I can complete certain features of activity | midterm week | technical details of methods and UI elements | other classes
|            | Matthew Stewart | Not knowing the requirements of project in general  |  Overall tiredness  |  Managing course load for all my classes  |  Failing to remember/document what I need to do  |  android architecture complexity  |  MIDTERMS  |  Conflicting views from resources on android development  |  New to working with a team to manage a large project  |  There is still a great amount of information to learn
| What insights have you made? |Chloe Adzima | We are all free to meet on Fridays | Learning how to connect activities in Android Studios | learned what we all think we could complete this sprint | Understand what we will do this sprint | understand the main idea of the app better after doing UML | Have a better understanding of how Android Studios works | Figured out how to get project from github onto Android Studio | Know how to make drop down menu now | Learned how to store data in database | Know how to record espresso test
|            | Megan Spiers |   No insights yet | Researched how the log in screen could work | Learn more about android UI Design | Better understanding of what is required of Us | Understand UML better | Learned to connect Activities | manage time better | Understand Android Studio better | Learn to use ListView and adapters | Learn to use Firebase better
|            | Matthew Scott |   No insights yet | learning android API / android studio and git | Learning more about intents | better understanding of the behavior of our app from diagrams | Meeting with TA cleared up some of our expected requirements | understanding UI elements and methods for them in AS | learned some more details about git so we can merge our work project easily | learned about different android versions and emulators
|            | Matthew Stewart | No insights yet  |  |  Time will be spent organizing various aspects of the project  |  I got an idea for how our system needs to work with other systems  |  ViewModels w/ single activity architecture may be effective  |  Large amt.s of data could slow things down  |  A good approach to architecture will become more apparent as we continue building  |  Structuring the project well will prevent redundencies  |  Trying new things will help the learning process
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? |Chloe Adzima | Not yet | Not yet | not yet | not yet | not yet | no, still in learning stage | need to update UI to follow our storyboard | need to figure out how to allow user to upload an image | no | no
|            | Megan Spiers |   Not yet | Not yet | Not yet | Not yet | Not yet | Not Yet | not Yet | not yet | possibily; condition and delivery attributes are reversed | no
|            | Matthew Scott |   Not yet | unsure yet | not yet | not yet | not yet, planning stage still seems good so far | not yet | no, havent pushed to repo yet | not yet
